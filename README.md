# Setting a plan

### initial start

- new branch
- npm i

### First

- file tree
  - App.js => Home.js => List.js && Controls.js?
  - just worry about making the app first and then you can refactor later.
- implement UI items (buttons, inputs, spans, headers)

### Second

- create functionality that a user can **ADD** a list item using useReducer (if you have to start with useState, go ahead)
- create functionality that a user can **DElETE** a list item
- create funtionality that a user can **EDIT** a list item
  - renders a conditional input populated with list item string and a save button

### Third

- TO BE DECIDED / add a new function of sorts
